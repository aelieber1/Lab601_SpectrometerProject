### Homework for 4/14/23
- The Jupyter Notebook named, `RGBA_Extraction.ipynb` we see code that can read in an RGBA image and extract the line plot and composite images for each Red, Blue, and Green Channel within the image. It utilizes the package Image from PIL. 


### Scripts:
- `SimulatedDataAnalysis.ipynb` - shows how image data can be simulated
- `TestingAnalysisMethods.ipynb` - this shows the initial work I did to attempt to understand how image data is stored within an image - the work I did after we found `Image Magick` is included in a different image analysis file.
- `IntensityWavelengthAnalysis.ipynb` - I found a few tutorials to work on gathering intensity vs wavelength plots from an image, so I plan to work through those in addition to Image Magick (fingers crossed!!)ÃŸ
